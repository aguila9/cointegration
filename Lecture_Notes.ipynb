Residual Covariance Matrix is very informative for co-linearity. It may suggest that either a pair of time series are driven by one factor, or they show a colinear regression (Regression analysis doesn’t like co-linearity). It is not good to have large numbers in the residual covariance matrix, it means you have a large amount of unexplained variance between two variables.\n",
